// 4. Predict the output of the following code snippet.
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main(){
int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;
cout<<*ptr<<" "<<a<<b;
}

/*
Output:
The program is correct and will compile but might result in runtime error.This is 
because ptr will have a garbage address which might even point to a location which 
does not belong to our program and hence might result in Segmentation Fault when we 
are trying to access it
